# Overview
This is the public release for the paper "Learning to Model Student Learning with 3.5 Million Program Traces". 

For the current submission, we release a small sample of our dataset and code that evaluats different metrics of program traces. 
Concretely, we release 50 traces for the "snowman" assignment from the ground truth data, synthetic model, last state model, and trace mode.
